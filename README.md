# Obaid Portfolio (Three.js)

A minimalist, grayscale landing page inspired by "The Queen" poster, using Three.js for a subtle animated background.

## How to run
Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser, or serve locally:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080
```

## Font
This project falls back to Google Font **Cinzel** but is styled for **The Queen** serif. 
To use it, place your licensed font files at:
```
assets/TheQueen.woff2
assets/TheQueen.woff
```
and the site will automatically use them.

## Replace portrait
Swap `assets/portrait.jpg` with your own image (same filename) for best results.
